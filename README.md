# Chronotopic Cartographies - Visualisation Generators, Texts, and Explanatory Guide

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/chronotopic-cartographies/visualisation-generators/HEAD)

This repository contains marked up texts, visualisations, and Python scripts for generating visualisations related to the AHRC-funded [*Chronotopic Cartographies for Literature*](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/chronotopic-cartographies/) project at Lancaster University. 

This readme file gives instructions on how to access the tools, either online or on your own computer. Once you're set up, you can get started using the tools by opening the 'start_here.ipynb' notebook.

## Accessing the Tools

### Python Notebooks
The tools for creating the Chronotopic Cartographies maps/graphs are a series of Jupyter iPython Notebooks (https://jupyter.org/), which are a way for running Python code in a (fairly) user-friendly way. 

There are two ways of running the notebooks. The easiest is to click on the link below, which will open an interactive version of this repository on mybinder.org. This is a good option if you want to try the tools without having to install anything on your own computer.

Once the binder has loaded, click on the 'start_here.ipynb' notebook, which contains information about the tools and how to start using them.

If you find them useful, you can open them on your own computer using Anaconda, which can be downloaded from here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

Once you've downloaded Anaconda, download this repository to your computer using the green 'code' link in the toolbar above. Open Anaconda and navigate to the place where you saved this repository then open the 'start_here.inpyb' notebook.

### Gephi
Whichever way you choose to run the notebooks, you will also need to install [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) on your computer. We use Gephi to lay out and edit graphs before exporting them to create the finished visualisations.
